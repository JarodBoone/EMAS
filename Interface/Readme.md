# EMAS Interface 
Within this subdirectory are a bunch of different shell scripts for interacting with gem5 and the EMAS models/scenarios. The primary interface is through command line input. The **Commands** subdirectory contains all of the command bindings that are multiplexed from user input

The EMAS.sh is setup in such a way that no EMAS_x command will be executed if the Simulator is not configured correctly
